# Dating Game

Looking for your soulmate? Then this probably isn't the app for you.  If you are using this app to find a soulmate you have a very sad life and I feel sorry for you.

This app asks you some very important questions that have nothing to do with how you really live your life, but could indicate your ability to live with another adult human for an extended period of time.  My husband and I have been living together for 10 years and we agree on most of these things.  This is the extent of the research that was done for this app.

# It's simple

1. Enter your name (or the name you want people to think you have).
1. Include a link to a picture of yourself (or of a picture from 10 years ago that you photoshopped to make you look like a model).
1. Answer the Questions
1. Tap submit and find your soulmate.
